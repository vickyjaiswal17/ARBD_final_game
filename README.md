# LCD Game
Hello everyone...<br>
The LCD game is a basic Arduino project in which we are trying to make a simple game with the help of some components like a 16x2 LCD display and push-buttons. In this game a Superhero character is dodging the obstacles. And the position of the Superhero is controlled by push buttons.
