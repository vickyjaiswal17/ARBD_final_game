# LCD Game
Hello everyone...<br>
The LCD game is a basic Arduino project in which we are trying to make a simple game with the help of some components like a 16x2 LCD display and push-buttons. In this game a Superhero character is dodging the obstacles. And the position of the Superhero is controlled by push buttons.
First, letâ€™s talk about the connections and the hardware.
The components required will be LCD, Push Button, Buzzer, and LEDs. Buzzer and LEDs are for sound and light effects in the game to make it more attractive. 
In this game we are going to use an Arduino based development board, ArBd1 to save time and extra efforts for connections.
